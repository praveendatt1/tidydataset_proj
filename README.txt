TIDY DATA SET Creation
==================================================================
For Project Demo Pursposes
==================================================================

This document explains the different code files and output files and code book files that are submitted here in the project.

As part of creation process,The Tidy data set created consists of multiple rows, which each row representing the mean and standard deviation for multiple variables/measurements extracted from the test and training data sets, across each activity and subject. It is obtained after prelimiary steps of data binding across all training data and data binding across all test data, and then later merging the training and test data sets. Then the required measures are only extracted i.e. of mean and standard deviation measurements. The descriptive activity data is obtained from activity data sets which is populated in tidy data sets. Variables are obtained from feature data.After all the cleaning steps, measurment data is grouped across each activity and subject and the final tidy data set is prepared.


Beloa are the files presented in this project:
=========================================

- README.txt
- Codebook.txt : contains the codebook, explaining the tidy data creation process and the varibles in the tidydataset and their description and details.
- run_analysis.R : R Script that is created in the project(tidydataset_proj), which is created and submitted to github repository. This contains series of R 		commands and functions that can be implemented in order for the creation of tidydataset using the source files.
-tidydataset.txt : "tidydataset.txt" is the final output data set created using all dataset collection, working and cleaning principles and is being                     submitted as part of project submission purposes.
